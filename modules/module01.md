An organization is created based on the account you used to sign in. Sign in to your organization at any time, (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}).

You can rename and delete your organization, or change the organization location. To learn more, see the following articles:

[Rename an organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/rename-organization?view=azure-devops)

[Change the location of your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/rename-organization?view=azure-devops)

If you signed in with an existing Microsoft account, your next step is to Create a project. If you signed in with a newly created Microsoft account, then your project is automatically created and named after your account name. To learn more about managing projects, see Manage projects.

## 2. Create organization or project collection

Learn how to create an organization. An organization is used to connect groups of related projects, helping to scale up an enterprise. You can use a personal Microsoft account, GitHub account, or a work or school account. Use your work or school account to automatically connect your organization to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## ❗ Note 

All organizations must be manually created via the web portal. We don't support automated creation of organizations. We do support automated organization configuration, project creation, and resource provisioning via REST API.
